## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="wilmar.jpg">

Hi! I am a mobile developer, with more than 6 years experience on [iOS](https://www.apple.com/ios), and other Apple platforms (macOS, watchOS, tvOS).

I've attended [WWDC](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/) in 2013 and 2016, attended an Apple Watch workshop in London before the launch of the product, and hosted the [Johannesburg CocoaHeads Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/CocoaHeads-Johannesburg/).

I live in South Africa, and currently work on projects in the medical and financial sector.
